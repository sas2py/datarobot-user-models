cd sas2py
cd wheel
./run.sh will create sas2py_runner wheel package

sas2py_runner is imported into sas2py_predictor.py

now model1.py shows a sample python code which is saved as dill file

drum score --code-dir model_templates/inference/python3_sas2py --input tests/testdata/boston_housing.csv --target-type regression

works as sas2py_predictor is loading the dill file and calls predict
